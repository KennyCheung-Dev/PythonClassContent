# Working with some real=life data in order to come to a conclusion
# This will take us 3 - 4 weeks in total

# Scenario:
# We are app developers looking to make a successful mobile app.
# We want to study the types of app that are successful

# Wtih Data Visualization - Python and pandas

# Through our analysism, we would want to  determine
# the most popuplar types of apps,
# Looking at # of installs,  ratings types and such
# Would also want to look at the difference between Android and iPhone

# Finding good data
# Kaggle is the world's largest data sciene community

# Planning
# What do we want to learn from the datasets
# in order to achieve our goal?




# Final Project:
# For the final section
# You'll be working on a large data visualization project of
# your own!
# You should choose a topic that you are interested
# It could be related to anything, demographics, economy, gaming
# Use Kaggle to look at the available datasets
# BE SURE TO FIND ONE THAT DOESN't NEED TOO MUCH DATA WRANGLING
# We have some backup topics, if you cannot  find one,
# but we can't guarantee that you'll be interested in them

# For this week, homework:
# Find a database/dataset you are interested in
# analyzing
# Any topic
# The more entries, the more accurate your analyzes would be
