To pass time Bessie the cow and her friends Elsie like to play a version of a agame they saw at the county fair.
To start, Bessie puts three inverted shells on a table and place a small round pebble under one of them

The standard version of the game th corws saw being played allowed the player to see the initial location,
and then required guessing its final location after all the swaps were complete.

However, they like a different version, Elsie does not know the initial location of the pebbles,
Bessie knowing the right answer, gives Elsie a score at the end equal to the number of correct guesses she made.

Given the swaps and guesses, but not the initial pebble location.
Please determine the highest possible score Elsie can get.

Input:

3
1 2 1
3 2 1
1 3 1

Output:

2
In this example Esie could have earned at most 2 points,
If the pebble started under shell 1, then she guessed exactly one right,
But if it started at shell 2, then she guesses right twice!
